Turning my Dungeons and Dragons Campaign map into a fully fledged Google Map-esque webpage. Using the wonderful Leaflet.js!

If you want to create a similar map for your own campaign map, I have written up the full process on my website: https://techtrail.net/creating-an-interactive-map-with-leaflet-js/

## Tools used for project
I used a range of tools for this project, the majority are for creating the interactive maps, but have also included the ones I used to create the initial map itself.
- [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/)
- [Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/photoshop.html)
	- [PS_Bramus.GoogleMapsTileCutter](https://github.com/bramus/photoshop-google-maps-tile-cutter)
